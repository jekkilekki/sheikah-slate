# Sheikah Slate

Project for "Computer Vision & AI" at Hanbat National University Spring 2021.

## Goals

The goals of this project are two-fold:

1. To deepen my knowledge of computer vision techniques and principles using OpenCV
2. To build something fun / slightly practical that I can actually install and use on my Android phone

## Technology

1. OpenCV library for Computer Vision
2. Python for OpenCV
3. React Native to build the app

## What I'm Building

In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for Nintendo Switch, the main character (Link) uses a tablet device known as a Sheikah Slate in order to interact with the world around him. 

This device is quite versatile and has (at least) the following functions, which I will do my best to recreate in the app:

1. Object detection: When a photo is taken of a certain object, the Sheikah Slate AI recognizes that object and can provide a handful of details about it.
2. Stasis (rune): When activated, the screen darkens and becomes slightly yellow in tint. Moving objects like living things and machines in motion will be highlighted in yellow and can be targeted. If the button is pressed while targeting a highlighted object, that object becomes temporarily "frozen" in time and space.
3. Magnesis (rune): When activated, the screen darkens and becomes slightly red in tint. Metal objects are highlighted in red and can be targeted. If the button is pressed while targeting a highlighted object, that object becomes magnetized and able to be easily moved around the environment within certain limitations.
4. Cryonis (rune): When activated, the screen darkens and becomes slightly blue in tint. Any liquid becomes highlighted in blue and can be targeted. If the button is pressed while targeting a highlighted area, a pillar of ice sprouts from the liquid at that location. Ice pillars are limited to three.
